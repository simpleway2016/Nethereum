            Merkle Patricia tree that encodes the storage contents of the account(a mapping between 256-bit
            integer values), encoded into the trie as a mapping from the Keccak 256-bit hash of the 256-bit
            Integer keys to the RLP-encoded 256-bit integer
            values.

            The hash of the EVM code of this
            account—this is the code that gets executed
               should this address receive a message call; it is
            immutable and thus, unlike all other fields, cannot be changed after construction.All such code
            fragments are contained in the state database under their corresponding hashes for later retrieval
